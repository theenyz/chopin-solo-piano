      Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) is one of the most renown composers.
      He who wrote primarily for the solo piano, and during his lifetime, wrote a variety of compositions, ranging from waltzes to polonaises. 
      With all of these compositions, one has to wonder - <b>what was the kind of composition Chopin enjoyed creating the most?</b>

      Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>This is focused on Chopin's solo piano works, so no concertos or pieces with other instruments are included.</li>
        <li>Some minor modifications were made.
            <ul>
              <li>All posthumously published works were removed because there were some inconsistencies in year data.</li>
              <li>If a composition was composed between a time period, the composition date was the average of the two.
                  E.g., a composition written between 1838-1839 would be averaged as 1838.5.</li>
