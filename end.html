        Overall, it can be noted that what is consistent is that <b>Chopin has always continuously created mazurkas throughout his composing career</b>.
        From the time he started composing, the longest time stretch Chopin went without composing a mazurka is 4 years.
        <br><br>
        A mazurka is a kind of Polish folk dance with a rich cultural and historical background. Chopin moved to Paris, France early in his music career.
        So, this is a sign that although he was not living in his home country, Chopin is proud of his Polish identity.
